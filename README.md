# MameBoxRomManager
Welcome to the MameBoxRomManager repository.

This little tool has been design to simply manage roms on a MAME Arcade System.

As I start WPF programming, the code is quiet dirty and unoptimized, feel free to improve it !

## Genesis
I made this software for me personnal use as I'm the owner of a PC Based Arcade machine,
I have on my computer the MAME fullset but i don't want the full romset on it. So
I've write this little software that list all the files from the fullset and let me select
only the games i want on my system.

## How to compile it ?
Clone this repo, open in VS2k17, install Nuget packages and compile it !

## TODO
* Handle CHD folders
* Preview games info
* Better UI
* Cleaner code
